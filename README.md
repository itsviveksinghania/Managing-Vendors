# Project Description:

The objective of this project is to create a Spring Boot-based web application that will allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on an entity called "Vendor." The application will use MySQL as its database and will be deployed on DigitalOcean.

The Vendor entity will have attributes such as name, email, phone number, address etc. The user will be able to create, read, update, and delete vendors using the application. The application will also have a feature that allows users to search for vendors by id or vendor code.

The application will have a 90%+ code coverage using JaCoCo, which is a code coverage tool that helps to measure the extent to which the code is tested. This will ensure that the application is thoroughly tested and free from any bugs or issues. Testing of the code is done via JUnit using Mockito

The UI of the application will be made using Swagger, which is a tool that helps to design, build, and document RESTful APIs. The Swagger UI will provide users with an interactive interface that they can use to perform CRUD operations on the Vendor entity.

The application will be deployed on DigitalOcean, which is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services such as computing, storage, and databases. The deployment will be done using DigitalOcean Droplet Linux Server, which is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy and scale web applications.

In summary, this project will create a Spring Boot-based web application that allows users to perform CRUD operations on a Vendor entity. The application will use MySQL as its database, and it will have a 90%+ code coverage using JaCoCo. The UI of the application will be made using Swagger, and the application will be deployed on DigitalOcean.
